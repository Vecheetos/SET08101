    <h1 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Woah! You have Magically Appeared in a Garden</h1>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;">How did that happen..</p>
    
    <h2>The Garden Itself</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">With a blink of an eye you are surrounded by a lush and infinite garden, plants of all kinds surround your feet, sprawling across the endless space. The book you had just touched has disappeared entierly from under your hands, even magical wizards need a hobby. Behind you five distinct portals float side by side, each one representing a different room within the tower, at least you aren't trapped.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Infront of you is a large pond with a flowing waterfall, the water is as clear and as bright blue as the sky, you can make out small bits of movement, fish swimming and frogs leaping.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">To your right is a myriad of flowers seperated into beds by a concrete pathway, out of the many flowers you see the most prominent seem to be thistles, maybe he likes those the best? or maybe they are for a particular spell. The pathway leads to a lone bench circled by more flowers. - it looks quite relaxing.</p>
        <p>To your left is a garden shed, it looks quite small for the wizard's taste, imagine all the crazy spells that are hiding it's true form, it must be like the tardis, it might be worth while investigating it further.
            
    <h2>The Pond</h2>
        <p>You get close to the pond, the tranquil nature bringing you comfort, the bottom of the lake has a large stone with the symbol of a thistle, he must really be proud of those. Many beautiful fish swim around the water, you watch as the Koi fish attempt one by one to leap up the waterfall. At the top of the waterfall rests a large Dragon, how did you not notice that before!? It seems friendly enough, maybe one of the Koi's ended up reaching the top after-all. The frogs leap from one lily pad to the next without a care in the world, you start to feel jealous... Not wanting to disturb the large slumbering dragon, you leave the pond alone for now.</p>
            
    <h2>The Flower Beds</h2>
        <p>The flowers are neatly organised, you can't tell if the wizard is really good at gardening or cheating by using spells, the sight is an impressive feat regardless. Butterflies roam freely between the nestled plants, you feel as though you could stay here forever. While thistles are the predominantly planted flowers, the contrasting colours of red Poppies clashing against bright green Zinnia's and Hellebores proves to be quite the visual spectical as you walk down the concrete pathways towards the bench, no wonder he kept this a secret.</p>
            
    <h2>The Lone Bench</h2> 
            <p>Sitting down upon the bench you can see the entire garden, you can look off into the far distance with no end in sight, the sun hasn't changed position since you entered, isn't it night back at the tower..? perhaps this garden is on a different continent, or maybe even a different dimension. Conveniently there is another note left by the wizard sitting next to you, almost as if it was placed there by someone writing a script, it seems to be detailing how he created this garden, this seems like a nice place to stop and read. <button onclick="openobject.call(this)" data-target-id="firstnote">Take a closer look?</button></p>
            <div id="firstnote" class="notes" style="display: none;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Finally, after years of hardwork and dedication my interdimensional garden is finished. Now the other wizard's won't make fun of me for looking after my plants! It was a long ride with so filled with many hardships.. who could've known plants need ultra-violet light to eat? I just thought they needed dirt...</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">The world looks so real you'd think you were still on earth! I could not be prouder, even the animals are content here. Though, that might be due to the spell I casted to make everyone feel comforted until they leave. Worth it, even though the spell cuts your life expectency down by half!</p>
            </div>

    <h2>The Garden Shed</h2>
            <p>You open up the garden shed... it's just a shed, there's no magical artifiacts at all, infact most of the tools within here seem to be cheap or rusty, that's disappointing, at least there's another note. <button onclick="openobject.call(this)" data-target-id="secondnote">Take a closer look?</button></p>
            <div id="secondnote" class="notes" style="display: none;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Wow! all the plants have been successfully planted now, it took a long time gathering them all especially all the eucalyptus plants, I had to teleport all the way to Australia for those, that weather is far too hot for a cloak like mine, I should've brought my ice staff! </p>
