    <h2>The Room Itself</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">This multi-level room is so large it can boggle the mind, large ladders slide across the bookshelves by themselves, periodically the occasional book will fly through the skies overhead before self sorting themselves into different sections. The walls are engraved with golden markings making the entire place feel oddly sophisticated, massive paintings across each wall of famous historically influential people.</p>
        <p>A lone desk sits in the entrance way acting almost as if a reception, on closer inspection you can see a sign suggesting to write what book you want to access. - You don't know what to look for, do you?</p>
            <p>Finally, a note lays next to the 'receptionist book', this might give you a clue on where to look next. <button onclick="openobject.call(this)" data-target-id="firstnote">Take a closer look?</button></p>
            <div id="firstnote" class="notes" style="display: none;">
                <p>Some Travler is making their way to my castle.. I can't think of any more questions! I suppose I could just steal them from the books within my library!</p>
                <p>I'll take from the last three historical books I've read!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Hundred Year War</li>
                    <li>The Russian Revolution</li>
                    <li>Gordian Knot</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The Travler would never know all three of those! unless he found this note I'm leaving next to the library for some reason.</p>
            </div>
            
    <h2>The Hundred Year War</h2>
        <p>You write down the name 'The Hundred Year War' within the 'receptionist book' and down flies a large book encased in a fine leather, it looks old. You can easily read through this book for hours! weirdly.. it seems to have every bit of information avaliable in the world! what a weird piece of enchantment. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War" target="_blank" style="color: #FF9900; text-decoration: none;">Open it?</a></p>
            
    <h2>The Russian Revolution</h2>
        <p>You write down the name 'The Russian Revolution' within the 'receptionist book' and down flies a large book encased in a deteriorated leather, the front is engraved with a hammer and sickle. Something tells you this story isn't going to have a happy ending... Weirdly, just like the last book this one seems to contain every bit of information avaliable in the world! what a weird piece of enchantment. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia" target="_blank" style="color: #FF9900; text-decoration: none;">Open it?</a></p>

    <h2>The Gordian Knot</h2>
        <p>You write down the name 'The Gordion Knot' within the 'receptionist book' and down flies... oh! this is just a regular paper back book, it looks like it's been delivered by amazon! that's not very magical. Unsurprisingly, once you open it up it seems to have every bit of information avaliable in the world! it was cool the first time, now you start to think the wizard has just gotten lazy with this section of tower, either way, you've got your book! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot#:~:text=Alexander%20the%20Great%20wanted%20to,half%20with%20a%20single%20stroke." target="_blank" style="color: #FF9900; text-decoration: none;">Open it?</a></p>
