    <h1 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 50px;">You have entered The Kitchen</h1>
    
    <h2>The Room Itself</h2>
        <p>The Kitchen is over cluttered, pots and pans litter all shelf space you can see. There are many sinks embedded within the counter tops, all of which are overflowing with dirty pots, plates and cutlery. You quickly notice a small goblin chopping vegetables, they are wearing a small chef hat and a uniform to match, they don't seem to react at all to your presence. There's a fish next to the Goblin, it doesn't appear to be cooked, but it does certainly look chopped up. The opposite side of the room fridges line the wall, right next to a large walk in freezer.</p>
            
    <h2>The Goblin</h2>
        <p>It still doesn't react as you get close, completely fixcated on chopping up the vegetables. "What's your name?" you ask, to which it to enthusiastically responds "Chop-Chop!" before continuing it's task. Taking a closer look at the vegetables, it seems to be chopping chilli's and not very well... clumps of chilli fly off with every slicing motion, getting on the floor or scattering around the room. You notice a note left for Chop-Chop left by the wizard, however for some reason it appears to be chopped up into many pieces, after reconfiguring the scraps it back into it's correct order you are able to <button onclick="openobject.call(this)" data-target-id="firstnote">Read the note?</button></p>  
        <div id="firstnote" class="notes" style="display: none;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">I am entrusting you with a very important task, I want you to carefully blend the chillies, your goal is to extract the Capsaicin from them so I can test my new recipe for my soon to be famous 'spicy' love potion.</p>
                <p>Careful! The capsaicin is what makes the chilli spicy, don't eat anything! and please <u>do not chop the chilli's</u></p>
        </div>    
        <p style="margin-top: 10px">Before leaving, you ask Chop-Chop what the Wizard is like to work with, their response is a simple "Chop-Chop!" You worry this joke is running stale, it wasn't even funny the first time, you decide it's best to find more clues elsewhere.</p>
            
    <h2>The Fish</h2>
        <p>The fish is sprawled out across the chopping board, cut into uneven and unclean chunks, there are multiple herbs and spices left out by the wizard, none of which seem to have ever be open. There's a cooking recipe labelled "How to cook Kedgeree", the only piece of information on the recipe that has survived is the mention of "smoked haddock." for some reason that piece of information still stands out, perhaps it's important for later. Predictably, the rest of the note is cut to ribbons.</p>
            
    <h2>The Fridges</h2>
        <p>You open each fridge one by one, each housing certain ingredient types. The vegetable fridge has a sticky note on the door, "Becareful in here, Chop-Chop! I'm keeping some rare carrots in this fridge, they are cultivated from carrots that were here before my spell gone wrong changed their colours worldwide!" that note seems oddly specific! perhaps it's important. After opening the fridge you can see all the carrots inside the fridge are purple, alongside some cabbages, calliflower and the usual ingredients. Weirdly, the meat fridge only holds copious amounts of chicken, what's up with that?</p>
            
    <h2>The Counter Tops</h2>
        <p>The Counter Tops are covered in mess, enchanted magical knives left aside with rusted flakes of food encrusted into them. There isn't much reason to continue to look around the dirty shelves, but at least you can say you tried.</p>
            
    <h2>The Walk-In Freezer</h2>
        <p>The ice cold temperature runs through your skin sending a shiver down your entire body as soon as you enter, leaning against the back wall is a magical wooden staff, it appears to be the source of the cool air coarsing through the room keeping the cool inside even with the open door, frozen meats and bread are frozen along the shelves and hanging off of racks, there's not much information to gather here. Perhaps you should try another room for more information about the wizard.<\p>
