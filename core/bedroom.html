    <h1 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 50px;">You have entered The Wizard's Bedroom</h1>
    
    <h2>The Room Itself</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">The room is dimly lit by a rusted chandelier, the cobblestone walls absorbing the heat from the candlelight as it lightly sways against the soft wind from an open window. Something small and black darts across your field of vision as you enter rushing towards the windowsill, alas... it moves too fast for you to process what it was, perhaps your mind is playing tricks on you?</p>
            <p>Across from you appears to be a rather large bed with a wooden nightstand accompanying it, on top of the nightstand holds multiple books as well as suspiciously unlabled potions. Above the bed-frame hangs multiple magical awards, paintings and skulls of various magical creatures.</p>
            <p>Next to the entrance of the room rests a large shovel propped against the wall, it's covered in fresh dirt, you question the point of <u>gardening tools</u> being placed within a tower with no garden... wait a minute, where'd the dirt come from!?</p>
            <p>The last thing to draw your eye is a fancy wardrobe towering over you, it does not appear to be locked.</p>
            
    <h2>The Nightstand</h2>
            <script src="/js/opennotes.js"></script>
            <p>You investigate the nightstand resting against a large bed at the back of the room, getting close you can see the drawer is slightly ajar, <button onclick="openobject.call(this)" data-target-id="firstnote">Open it?</button></p>
            <div id="firstnote" class="notes" style="display: none;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">I cannot believe it! I managed to get my <u>favourite book</u> signed at Wizard-Con! I will cherish it forever and leave it by my bedside table. This would make for a great question to give travelers. The only way they'd know is if they rudely looked through my things without my permission and read my diary... no one would be that inconsiderate though!</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Wizard-Con was such a success, I even managed to show off my new 'Teleportation' trick. Originally I infused a magic book with the spell so I could easily cast it without lifting a finger.. but moving a book that teleports you the moment you touch it proved surprisingly difficult. I never really thought it through. At least casting it myself worked just as well!</p>
            </div>    
            <p style="margin-top: 10px">Inspecting the books resting on-top of the stand reveals a signed copy of "The colour of Magic" which seems oddly important, perhaps it holds some significance? Multiple Gardening books, wasn't he supposed to be a wizard? Finally, a book encased in black leather discussing a lizard janitorial service? you don't feel inclined to read any further.</p>
            
    <h2>The Trophy Wall</h2>
            <p>Approaching the decorated wall above the bed, something feels off. Somehow, you don't believe a diploma from "Wizarding Online College" counts as a real qualification, who would go through the effort of hanging this up? Above the questionable certificates dangles multiple stuffed creature heads including a Unicorn, Manticore and even a Griffin. - You start to wonder if this is very ethical. There's also a child-like drawing of the wizard drawn in crayon, you didn't realise he had a kid! but on closer inspection you realise it was signed by himself, oh...
                
    <h2>The Windowsill</h2>
            <p>You recall the small object that scampered off to this Windowsill, it has made it's way to the outside balcony. You don't remember a door-way to get to the balcony, so you decide to climb out the window after it. The creature lays bundled up into what seems like a black ball of furr, <button onclick="openobject.call(this)" data-target-id="outside">touch the small creature?</button></p>
            <div id="outside" style="display: none;">
                <p>The creature turns and hisses! it was a cat! a small red collar bursts from it's neck and lands on the balcony fence. After picking up the collar and reading the name-tag labelled "Fore" the cat trots off and looks up at the moon, you look too and take in the beautiful view.</p>
                <img src="images/cat.png" alt="This was a picture.. not anymore" class="center" width="auto" height="auto" style="margin-bottom: 2px;">
            </div>
            <p>The wind picks up as a chill runs through your body, "perhaps it's a good time to get back inside" you think to yourself before climbing back into the Bedroom.</p>

    <h2>The Shovel</h2>
            <p>The Shovel feels out of place to be left within a bedroom, with closer inspection you can see a word etched within the wooden handle... it reads 'Seventh' followed by an engraving of a 'moon' rubbing the dirt against it's brass confirms that it had only recently been used, you don't seem to recall any dirt patches within the castle, was it a spell gone wrong? or something more?
    
    <h2>The Wardrobe</h2>
            <p>You open the wardrobe, peering inside... strangely, there only appears to be two cloaks hanging within, infact... they seem to be identical and look just like the clothes you just saw the wizard in, "Wizard's aren't exactly known for their fashion sense I suppose" you reason to yourself. Outside of this weird revelation there isn't anything else of interest inside, perhaps you should try another room for more information about the wizard.
